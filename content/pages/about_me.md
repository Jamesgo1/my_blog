Hello, and thanks for visiting my website! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

I am a proud dad to two mad kids that I love more than anything. And my wife Olivia who is the best person I've ever 
met.

I currently work as a data engineer working at 
[Companies House](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/companies-house). In terms of work, I love being creative and learning new things so programming turned out to be 
the perfect job for me. I really like being in a job where there is always a way to learn new things and solve new 
problems.

I am also currently studying part-time for an MSc in Software Development at 
[Queen's University Belfast](https://www.qub.ac.uk/). 

Outside of work and family, I like football, poker (used to be my job), and tennis. I also like writing too, which 
is mainly why I decided to make this blogging website.

I am originally from the south-east of England and moved to Belfast in 2020, It has definitely been quite isolating 
moving to a new place with family life and working from home. But I'm hoping to try and be a bit more social going 
forward. 

If you've any feedback at all, please feel free to contact me at the social media links at the bottom of the site.
